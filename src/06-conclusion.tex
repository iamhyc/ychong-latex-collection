In this word, a distributed and asynchronous job dispatching design is considered in an edge computing network residing in a MAN with multiple APs and edge servers.
The APs and edge servers periodically broadcast their local state information to facilitate distributed dispatcher design.
Due to random transmission latency, the system information observed at different dispatchers are asynchronous.
It's reasonable to assume that not all the state information can be observed by each AP in a practical scenario.
Hence, the distributed optimization of job dispatching strategies is formulated at all the APs as a POMDP, whose minimization objective is a discount measurement of job delivery and computation time.
A novel low-complexity distributed solution framework is proposed based on analytical approximation of value function and one-step policy iteration, where the complicated POMDP solution or value iteration is avoided and the analytical performance lower bound is derived.
The simulation results show that the proposed solution framework outperforms various benchmarks.
In the future work, the proposed framework will be attended to a more general scenario where the knowledge on the distributions of signaling latency, uploading latency and computation time is absent.
The reinforcement learning would be integrated with the proposed solution framework to address the above issue.
